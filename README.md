## Project: Data Pipeline with DVC and MLFLOW for Machine Learning
This projects demonstrates how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) for data and model versioning, and MLFlow Experiment tracking, this project focuses on training a Random Forest Classifier on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset,  with clear stages of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
